# Introduction

This project is a part of the **Front End Libraries Certification** course on FreeCodeCamp, and has been built using **React**.

On the webpage are a set of keys with alphabets written inside them. When the user clicks on a key, a unique sound is emitted. 
The user can also use the corresponding keys from the keyboard to trigger the sounds.

The project has been hosted on Netlify and can be found [here](https://react-drum-ashish.netlify.app/)

Some unittests and user stories have been provided by FreeCodeCamp and all of them pass successfully. They can be tested by clicking in the hamburger menu in the top right.
